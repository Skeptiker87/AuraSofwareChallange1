### Final
This is my final solution for the java challenge.
This solution results in a clear JSON, but its hardly limited to primitives, strings, primitive wrappers, arrays, JSONObject, JSONArray and JsonMarshalInterface.

Only relevant file is https://github.com/Skeptiker87/AuraSofwareChallange1/blob/master/Challenge1/app/src/main/java/com/aurasoftwareinc/java/challenge1/JsonMarshal.java
This file is documented with java doc.

Note that there is also an alternative solution which can be found at: https://github.com/Skeptiker87/AuraSofwareChallange1/tree/alternative_-_universal
