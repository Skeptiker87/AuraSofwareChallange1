### Final
This is my final solution for the java challenge.
Note that there is also an alternative solution which can be found at: https://github.com/Skeptiker87/AuraSofwareChallange1/tree/alternative_-_universal

This solution results in a clear JSON, but its hardly limited to primitives, strings, primitive wrappers, arrays, JSONObject, JSONArray and JsonMarshalInterface.
Only modified class is JsonMarshal.java. This class is documented with java doc.
